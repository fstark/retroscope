# vdiskcat
Scan vintage HFS disks

Write a C++ command line that takes a file in argument. It checks if the file is a vintage macintosh HFS disk image and process all the HFS partitions withing. If the file is just a partition it processes it.
Processing means printing the disk volume name, as stored in the partition.
